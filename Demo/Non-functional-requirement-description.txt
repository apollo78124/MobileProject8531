My new features in the card are non-functional features.

1. Input Validation / Integrity Constraints to prevent entry of erroneous data.
(1) Add maxLength property to TextInput component on a few screens, so that there's a maximum length of the entered content
(2) Add length checking of certain property in submit function, and it gives alert if the content's length is longer than a given value.
Since (1) is already added, (2) should not happen.

2. Reliable transport i.e. retrying if transport error
(1) Add a function performWithRetry in mockData.js to implement failure try mechanism
(2) Apply this function on firebase functions (addDoc, updateDoc, getDocs etc.)
(3) When there's connection issue of other errors from firebase service, it will retry a configurable times, and the delay time is also configurable.
